* anyrun-exec

This is a quick and dirty [[https://github.com/Kirottu/anyrun/][anyrun]] plugin to launch programs from the search path. Note that terminal applications also show up in the list, but will not work (unless you don't care about the output).

This works perfectly fine without a configuration, though search path and number of entries to display can be customised:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
// <Anyrun config dir>/exec.ron
Config(
  path: Some([ "/usr/bin", "/bin" ])
  max_entries: 5,
)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Path is an optional value, and will fall back to the content of the =PATH= environment variable if empty or omitted.

Prebuilt binaries of both anyrun and my plugins are available for opensuse in [[https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:bhwachter:desktop][my OBS repository]].
